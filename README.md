# JWST Image Analysis with Python and Dash
 This repository contains the code for a web-based image analysis tool designed to explore and analyze images captured by the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST). Using Python and Dash, the tool provides interactive functionality for spectrum analysis, image filtering, and star detection.

# Features
 1. Upload JWST images for analysis
 2. Perform spectrum analysis and visualize the extracted spectra
 3. Apply Gaussian, median, and maximum filters to enhance image quality
 4. Detect stars within the images and display their positions
 5. User-friendly interface built with Dash for easy interaction
# Getting Started
    Clone this repository: git clone https://github.com/your-username/JWST-Image-Analysis-Dash.git
# Run the Dash application: 
    python app.py
# Access the application in your browser at 
    http://localhost:8050
# Usage
1. Upload a JWST image by dragging and dropping or selecting a file
2. Explore the spectrum analysis graph to visualize the intensity distribution
3. Compare the original and filtered images to examine image enhancements
4. Analyze the detected stars and their positions in the stars table
